Quantum Scientist interested in accurate predictions for quantum many-body systems.

I have explored Green's function techniques for molecules, tensor network states for schematic hamiltonians, and coupled-cluster wave functions for strongly correlated hamiltonians.

Recently, I have made the shift to quantum computing where I explore near-term applications in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning.
