I got the opportunity to fill in for a last minute cancellation at the CQIQC-VIII. I made an overview of the quantum machine learning topics that we are currently investigating.

Optimization of parametrized circuits has proven very powerful for solving quantum chemistry problems on near-term quantum devices.
Similar ideas can be applied to transfer the classical machine learning toolbox into the quantum realm.
I'll present our group's recent work on hybrid quantum algorithms for machine learning including the quantum variational autoencoder, the quantum generator and a proposal for a spiking quantum neuron.
