To improve their efficiency, spiking architectures often run on custom-designed neuromorphic hardware, but, despite their attractive properties, these implementations have been limited to digital systems. We describe an artificial quantum spiking neuron that relies on the dynamical evolution of two easy to implement Hamiltonians and subsequent local measurements. The architecture allows exploiting complex amplitudes and back-action from measurements to influence the input. This approach to learning protocols is advantageous in the case where the input and output of the system are both quantum states. We demonstrate this through the classification of Bell pairs which can be seen as a certification protocol. Stacking the introduced elementary building blocks into larger networks combines the spatiotemporal features of a spiking neural network with the non-local quantum correlations across the graph.\n","tags":["Quantum Computing","Quantum Machine Learning","Neuromorphic Networks"],"title":"An Artificial Quantum Spiking Neuron","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Degroote"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556412193,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556412193,"objectID":"69555cc2aee6a8173a7764adac32c4ee","permalink":"https://mfdgroot.github.io/talk/vbff/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T20:43:13-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/vbff/","section":"talk","summary":"Short blitz talk of the progress of our group.

Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging complexity landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This article is an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing, and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.\n","tags":["Quantum Computing","Quantum Chemistry"],"title":"Quantum Chemistry in the Age of Quantum Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacob M.

However, they are very different. Single reference coupled cluster is highly successful for treating weakly correlated systems but fails under strong correlation unless one sacrifices good quantum numbers and works with broken-symmetry wave functions, which is unphysical for finite systems. Symmetry projection is effective for the treatment of strong correlation at the mean-field level through multireference non-orthogonal configuration interaction wavefunctions, but unlike coupled cluster, it is neither size extensive nor ideal for treating dynamic correlation. We here examine different scenarios for merging these two dissimilar theories. We carry out this exercise over the integrable Lipkin model Hamiltonian, which despite its simplicity, encompasses non-trivial physics for degenerate systems and can be solved via diagonalization for a very large number of particles. We show how symmetry projection and coupled cluster doubles individually fail in different correlation limits, whereas models that merge these two theories are highly successful over the entire phase diagram. Despite the simplicity of the Lipkin Hamiltonian, the lessons learned in this work will be useful for building an ab initio symmetry projected coupled cluster theory that we expect to be accurate in the weakly and strongly correlated limits, as well as the recoupling regime.\n","tags":["Lipkin","Symmetry breaking and restoration"],"title":"Merging symmetry projection methods with coupled cluster theory: Lessons from the Lipkin model Hamiltonian","type":"publication"}]
